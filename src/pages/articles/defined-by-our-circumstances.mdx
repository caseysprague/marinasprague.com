We often talk about how circumstances do not define us, but our reaction to those circumstances does. Something recently has made me doubt this. We recently did a privilege walk in a Valor activity, where you stand in a line and then take a step backward or forward according to a defining statement that is read. The goal of this activity is to create an image of privileges in society. ​​People talk about privilege all the time. Even as I sit here, typing this in a coffee shop, I heard a group of people say: "If they just new how privileged they are!"

The embedded video shows different questions than the ones I was asked, but the point is that the questions being asked are all based on factors outside of your control. As the activity progressed, my sadness grew as I kept getting left behind by the others. When the activity was over, I was all the way in the back, with only one other participant near me.

I was sad and shocked to say the least.

As questions began filling my head, I started to feel like a lesser person. Up to this point, I would never have said that I had been robbed of any privileges. My parents are amazing, they have raised me up to be independent and secure in who I am, and they never made me feel like I lacked anything. They made me very aware of all the blessings I had in my life, and I was always aware that I had things that were not essential -- privileges. I feel thankful in saying that I had an amazing childhood. Still, this activity, in some way, tugged at my insecurities. Somehow I felt like more value was being placed on other people. You might say, "wait, didn't you just say that this activity was all about factors that you can't control?" Yes, and the idea of being seen as less hit me hard.
​
When we reconvened from the activity, I sat there trying to process my feelings. We talked as a group about how no matter where we came from we are all here teaching and challenging each other. The more I think about it, the more I realize that my experiences have made me the person I am. I would not change them for anything. It is up to us to take our situation and create something out of it. At the end of the day, you could have had all of the "privileges" in the world, but if you did not take advantage of them, they were there for nothing. I think it all comes back to your attitude towards your circumstances, if we decide to make it a great day or not.

In closing, I want to challenge you to be a little uncomfortable and check your perspective:
