Apple hosted their fist event in Chicago on Tuesday and it was geared towards education! I am a teacher at a STEM school and our teaching goes in hand with technology. It so important that, as educators, we are aware of changes, updates, new tools and new avenues we can use to enhance student's learning.  In our district, every student has an iPad and sometimes I feel like there is so much more that we could be doing with these devices. â€‹While these updates do not come until June, this has made me think about the new ways the students can use their devices.

Here are some updates that I am really excited about:
+ New iPad, compatible with the Apple Pencil.
+ Updates to iOS that allow drawing on projects and allows teachers to grade student work.
+ New app called Schoolwork that allows teachers to assign custom handouts, including handout activities in third party apps like IXL and Kahoot!
+ Apple-built coding and creative curricula for teachers.
+ And Apple Classroom app for Mac!

After researching and writing this post I decided to get more familiar with the apps from Apple. I realized that there were some apps that I was not using because I thought they would be too difficult for the kids, or not applicable to my content area (like GarageBand.) I was pleasantly surprised to find that some of the apps that I have been using are not as user friendly as the apps available from Apple. When I was taking quizzes to become an Apple Teacher, it really got me thinking about different ways to enhance student's learning and integrate multiple apps to create an amazing learning opportunity for our students.

I am so excited for June!
