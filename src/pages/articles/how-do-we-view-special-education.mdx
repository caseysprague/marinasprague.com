What is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the words “special education?“ For me that image has changed through the years, especially now that I teach inside the classroom.

The things that special education covers has changed throughout the years but the stigma or label that these two words bring has not. [Click here for a list of services covered by special education](https://www.understood.org/en/school-learning/special-services/special-education-basics/conditions-covered-under-idea).

Special education focuses on children that have difficulty learning, it is a big range of services that are tailored for each student that qualifies for them.

This program’s goal is to help students that have trouble learning, creating the least restrictive environment and meeting them where they are so they can meet their goals. This has nothing to do with their IQ, intelligence, or success potential; it has everything to do with what the child needs right now. Studies show that 13% of students in the public education system qualify for special education services ([source](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cgg.asp)). Out of 100 children, 13 of those children would have a learning disability. So why are these children not receiving services? This is a difficult question. Some of it has to do with the difficulty of figuring out what the student needs, maybe parents hesitate because of that “special education“ label, or maybe limited resources. There is a number of reasons why this could be happening, but I want to focus on our perception of the students that need help.

## Teachers
When we receive a student with a special education label what is your first thought? Do you think it is the special education teacher’s responsibility to teach your student? It depends on each case, but that label is not an excuse to not have high expectations of that student. They may have a learning disability but that does not mean that they cannot be successful and make academic progress in the classroom. For example, let’s say your student has dyslexia – a reading disability that requires assistance with specific skills outside the classroom – but the expectation is still for that child to read even though they learn to read differently. A learning disability is not an excuse for lack of learning. Every single student with a disability will have challenges, but their challenges do not define them. Your responsibility is to teach and help them grow the best you can when they are in your classroom.

## Parents
If your child qualifies for special education services this does not mean that your child is not smart, it just means their brain processes things differently and it is is our job as adults, teachers and professionals to do our best for your child. Unfortunately, a lot of the time we can’t provide these services without a diagnosis. Special education service are only provided to eligible students.

Sometimes a general education teacher cannot provide the necessary tools inside the classroom. Sometimes a teacher needs help and this is what this program provides: special education teachers.

If we change our perception on how we view special education, and see it for what it really is: a resource, a source to help children learn better from specialists, our reaction to hearing these two words would change. I think we would stop viewing this program as a burden or as a label that is going to limit their success. We need to start viewing it as an opportunity to help a struggling child succeed.

I challenge you to change your view on Special Education!
